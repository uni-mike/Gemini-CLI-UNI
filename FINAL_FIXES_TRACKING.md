- ✅ **Database Schema**: Cache table with proper indexing
- ✅ **Cache Persistence**: WORKING - 2 embeddings stored (131KB total)
- ✅ **Embedding Storage**: Database cache entries with proper categorization
- ✅ **Cache Resurrection**: WORKING - restored 2 entries from database
- ✅ **Real Integration**: Embeddings trigger cache → database persistence chain

### Test Results
```
🎉 Cache-Embedding Integration Test Complete!

✅ In-memory cache working: Yes
✅ Database persistence working: Yes
✅ Cache resurrection working: Yes
```

### Technical Achievements
- **Database Path Consistency**: Fixed relative path usage `./.flexicli/flexicli.db`
- **Embedding Generation**: 3072-dimension embeddings cached properly
- **Cache Statistics**: 131KB total size, avg 65KB per embedding
- **Persistence Mechanism**: 5-minute intervals + force persistence working
- **FIFO Cleanup**: Maintains 1000 entry limit with age-based expiration

## ✅ ACHIEVED MILESTONES

### Core System Functionality
- **🎉 TOKEN TRACKING** - DeepSeek API token counts persist correctly to sessions table (2282 tokens validated)
- **🎉 SESSION SNAPSHOTS** - turnCount and lastSnapshot fields persist with direct database updates
- **🎉 EXECUTION LOGS** - Tool executions tracked with proper timing (8 entries with 2-3ms duration)
- **🎉 KNOWLEDGE STORAGE** - 30 structured entries with 368+ chars of meaningful JSON data
- **🎉 DATABASE FLOWS** - All app-to-database flows validated and working
- **🎉 DIRECTORY CLEANUP** - Removed unused infrastructure (cache, checkpoints, sessions)

### Technical Achievements
- All modules have comprehensive logging (Orchestrator, Planner, Executor)
- yoga-layout build issues resolved with headless testing bypass
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors and dependency conflicts
- Installed missing dependencies and resolved package configuration

---

## 🧠 KEY METHODOLOGICAL INSIGHTS

### 1. **Use Existing Data - Avoid Over-Engineering**
- **Approach**: Direct database updates using DeepSeek API's token counts
- **Result**: Eliminated complex token budget synchronization issues
- **Lesson**: Always check if the solution already exists in available components

### 2. **Real Agent Testing is Critical**
- **Approach**: Validate with actual agent execution, not synthetic tests
- **Result**: Discovered integration issues missed by unit tests
- **Lesson**: "ALL final tests MUST be via real agent" - build proper validation tools

### 3. **Create Dependency Bypasses**
- **Approach**: Headless testing mode for yoga-layout ESM/CJS conflicts
- **Result**: Maintained development momentum despite blocking dependencies
- **Lesson**: Build alternatives when dependencies block core functionality

### 4. **Database Validation Reveals Truth**
- **Approach**: SQL queries to verify system health
- **Result**: Identified 98% of app-to-database flows were broken
- **Lesson**: Application logs can lie; database state reveals actual system health

## 🛠️ YOGA-LAYOUT FIX & INTERACTIVE TESTING PLAN

### Current Yoga-Layout Issue
- **Problem**: `yoga-wasm-web@0.3.3` contains top-level await in CJS format, blocking CLI execution
- **Usage**: Only required for Ink UI rendering in interactive mode (NOT core agent execution)
- **Status**: Headless mode works perfectly via `test-token-real-agent.ts`

### When Yoga-Layout is Needed
1. **Interactive UI Mode**: When user runs `npx tsx src/cli.tsx` without `--non-interactive`
2. **Monitoring Interface**: Real-time agent monitoring with Ink-based UI
3. **User Input Prompts**: Interactive approval system and live command feedback
4. **Development Console**: Visual debugging and status displays

### When Yoga-Layout is NOT Needed
1. **Headless Agent Execution**: `test-token-real-agent.ts` (WORKING NOW)
2. **Non-Interactive CLI**: `npx tsx src/cli.tsx --prompt "task" --non-interactive`
3. **Architecture Audits**: Database validation, memory testing, execution flows
4. **Production Automation**: Batch processing, scheduled tasks, API integrations

### Fix Implementation Strategy ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Phase 1**: Create conditional Ink loading in `src/cli.tsx` ✅
   - ✅ Check if interactive mode is required
   - ✅ Dynamically import Ink components only when needed
   - ✅ Fall back to console-based interface for non-interactive

2. **Phase 2**: Runtime UI bypass ✅
   - ✅ Modify entry point to detect `--non-interactive` flag early
   - ✅ Skip all UI imports when running headless
   - ✅ Maintain full agent functionality without yoga-layout

**VALIDATION RESULT**: Direct CLI execution successful! Test file created: `yoga-fix-test.txt`

### Interactive Testing Protocol
**When YOU provide test commands, I will:**
1. Execute exact command you specify
2. Monitor logs and results in real-time
3. Report back: success/failure, output, database state, memory changes
4. Provide next recommended test based on results
5. Track all findings in this tracking file

**Test Progression:**
1. Fix yoga-layout → Enable direct CLI execution
2. Architecture audit → Validate Orchestrator/Planner/Executor
3. Memory validation → Check layers, embeddings, caching
4. Knowledge base audit → Ensure usable KB beyond history
5. Module communication → Validate Trio patterns
6. Documentation alignment → Verify code matches plans

**Interactive Mode Testing (Post-Fix):**
- User approval workflows
- Real-time monitoring integration
- Visual debugging interfaces
- Live command feedback systems
