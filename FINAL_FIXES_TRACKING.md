# FlexiCLI - Current Issues Tracking

## 🔴 ACTIVE ISSUES REQUIRING RESOLUTION

### 🚨 Issue #1: Cache Table Empty - Memory Pipeline Not Triggering Embeddings
**Status**: 🟡 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - MULTIPLE FIXES APPLIED**
**Problem**: Cache table has 0 records despite working architecture, embeddings not being generated during agent execution
**Evidence**:
- ✅ CacheManager connected to database (`📦 CacheManager connected to shared database`)
- ✅ EmbeddingsManager properly integrated in memory pipeline
- ✅ Memory layers (RetrievalLayer, GitContextLayer) receive EmbeddingsManager instance
- ✅ **FIXED**: Database timing issue - cache restoration now works
- ✅ **FIXED**: Embedding API environment variables are properly loaded
- ❌ Cache table empty: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Cache` = 0

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **CacheManager Database Timing Fix (src/cache/CacheManager.ts:74-78)**:
   - Fixed race condition where `loadPersistedCache()` was called before database connection
   - Now calls `loadPersistedCache()` in `setPrisma()` method after database is ready
   - **Result**: "📂 Restored 0 cache entries from database" instead of "Database not ready, skipping cache restoration"

2. **Environment Variables Verified (.env)**:
   - All required EMBEDDING_API_* variables are present and loading correctly
   - `EMBEDDING_API_ENDPOINT=https://unipathai7556217047.openai.azure.com`
   - `EMBEDDING_API_KEY=9c5d0679299045e9bd3513baf6ae0e86`
   - `EMBEDDING_API_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-3-large`
   - `EMBEDDING_API_API_VERSION=2024-02-01`

**Architecture Analysis**:
- ✅ **Memory Pipeline**: Working (MemoryManager → EmbeddingsManager → CacheManager)
- ✅ **Cache Integration**: Working (EmbeddingsManager calls `cacheManager.set()`)
- ✅ **Database Connection**: Working (CacheManager connects correctly, SQL queries visible)
- ✅ **API Configuration**: Working (all environment variables loaded)
- ❌ **Memory Layer Activation**: RetrievalLayer not being triggered during simple tasks

**Current Investigation**: Memory layers (GitContext, Retrieval) are initialized but not actively used during simple agent tasks like file creation. Embeddings generation only occurs when these layers are actively queried for relevant context.

### ✅ Issue #2: Obsolete Directory References (FIXED)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
**Problem**: ENOENT errors accessing `.flexicli/cache` directory
**Evidence**:
- ✅ No more `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '.flexicli/cache'`
- ✅ Clean agent execution: `Cache cleanup skipped - using database-only caching`
- ✅ Directory structure updated properly

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Deprecated `cleanCache()` method in project-manager.ts
- ✅ Updated initialize-db.ts to only create `logs/` directory
- ✅ Added deprecation warnings for obsolete path methods

**Validation**: Agent runs without filesystem errors

---

### ✅ Issue #3: Agent Lock System (FIXED)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent agents could run simultaneously
**Evidence**:
- ✅ Agent lock properly acquired: `🔐 Agent lock acquired (PID: 87538)`
- ✅ Concurrent execution denied properly
- ✅ Per-project isolation working

**Validation**: Battle tested with concurrent execution attempts

---

### ✅ Issue #4: CacheManager Database Connection (FIXED)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**
**Problem**: CacheManager.prisma was null, no database persistence
**Evidence**:
- ✅ SharedDatabase integration working: `✅ Shared database initialized with CacheManager integration`
- ✅ No more null pointer errors
- ✅ Graceful fallback when database not ready

**Validation**: CacheManager connects to database successfully

---

## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS

**Primary Task**: Investigate why Cache table remains empty despite working database connection

**Investigation Steps**:
1. ✅ Confirmed CacheManager connects to database
2. ✅ Confirmed agent execution completes successfully
3. 🔄 **NEXT**: Force embedding generation and verify cache persistence
4. 🔄 **NEXT**: Run comprehensive agent test with embedding-heavy tasks
5. 🔄 **NEXT**: Check if embeddings generation is even being triggered

**Success Criteria**: Cache table shows embedding records after agent execution

## 📊 SYSTEM HEALTH STATUS

**Database Tables**:
- ✅ Sessions: 72 records (working)
- ✅ ExecutionLog: 35+ records (working)
- ✅ Knowledge: 39+ records (working)
- ❌ Cache: 0 records (empty - this is the focus)

**Architecture**:
- ✅ Agent lock system working
- ✅ SharedDatabase coordinating all connections
- ✅ CacheManager connected to database
- ✅ No filesystem cache errors
- ❌ Embeddings not reaching cache storage

**Next Steps**: Run embedding-heavy agent task and trace the cache persistence flow.
