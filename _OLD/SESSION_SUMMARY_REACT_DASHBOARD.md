# UNIPATH FlexiCLI React Dashboard Session Summary

## Date: 2025-09-10

## Objective
Create a React-based monitoring dashboard to replace the broken HTML/JavaScript UI for UNIPATH FlexiCLI system.

## Key Requirements
1. Replace HTML UI on port 4000 with React app on port 3000
2. Backend on port 4000 should only serve API endpoints (no HTML)
3. Use Material-UI components for professional design
4. Display real data from backend, no mock data
5. Dark theme with thin scrollbars
6. Fix all UI/UX issues

## Work Completed

### 1. React Dashboard Setup
- Created new React app in `/src/monitoring/react-dashboard`
- Installed dependencies: React 18, TypeScript, Material-UI, Recharts, vis-network
- Set up development environment with Create React App

### 2. Components Created/Updated

#### App.tsx (Main Component)
- Tab navigation between Overview, Pipeline, Memory, Sessions
- Fetches data from backend API every 5 seconds
- Fixed API data mapping for real backend responses

#### Dashboard.tsx
- Converted to Material-UI components
- Smaller metric cards with icons
- Fixed Memory Layers donut chart
- Real-time token usage tracking
- Tool usage grid with MUI components

#### SessionsView.tsx
- Complete rewrite using MUI DataGrid
- Added search and filter functionality
- Proper pagination controls
- Fixed grid alignment issues
- Full page width utilization

#### PipelineView.tsx
- Updated to show real UNIPATH architecture:
  - Orchestrator Coordinator
  - Task Decomposer
  - Embeddings Processor
  - Vector DB (Chroma)
  - RAG Retrieval
  - DeepSeek LLM
  - Tool Executor (Bash, File, Web tools)
  - Response Formatter

#### MemoryView.tsx
- Needs update: Replace cards with bar chart

### 3. Key Fixes Applied

#### Data Issues Fixed
- Token Usage object parsing (was showing [object Object])
- Dashboard metrics showing real values instead of 0
- Sessions data using real API responses

#### UI Issues Fixed
- Dark theme consistency across all components
- Recharts tooltip colors for dark theme
- Session Management grid alignment
- Smaller, more compact metric cards
- MUI DataGrid for professional tables

### 4. Pending Tasks

#### High Priority
1. **Remove HTML serving from port 4000** - Backend still serves HTML, needs to be API-only
2. **Fix TypeScript errors in SessionsView** - Grid2 component and type annotations
3. **Ensure React app runs properly on port 3000**

#### Medium Priority
1. Replace Memory Management cards with bar chart
2. Simplify Pipeline Visualization with real-time data
3. Update ToolModal to show actual tool calls
4. Add dark theme scrollbars globally

## Commands to Run

### Start React Dashboard (Port 3000)
```bash
cd /Users/mike.admon/UNIPATH_PROJECT/gemini-cli/unipath-clean/src/monitoring/react-dashboard
npm start
```

### Backend API (Port 4000) - Needs Fix
The backend at port 4000 needs to be updated to remove HTML serving and only provide API endpoints.

## Next Steps for New Session

1. **Fix Backend Server**
   - Find `/src/monitoring/backend/server.ts`
   - Remove all HTML serving code
   - Keep only API endpoints

2. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Update SessionsView.tsx with proper type annotations
   - Use Grid2 component from MUI properly

3. **Complete UI Updates**
   - Replace Memory Management cards with bar chart
   - Add global dark theme scrollbars
   - Simplify Pipeline Visualization

4. **Testing**
   - Ensure React app works on port 3000
   - Verify all API endpoints work correctly
   - Test real-time data updates

## Technical Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Material-UI v5 + MUI DataGrid
- Recharts for charts
- vis-network for pipeline visualization
- Express.js backend (port 4000)
- CORS enabled for API access

## User Feedback Summary
- "Token Usage need to stringify as its object" ✅ Fixed
- "Memory Layers and Token Distribution should be thin donut not pie" ✅ Fixed
- "Session Management grid looks like shit" ✅ Fixed with MUI DataGrid
- "Pipeline Visualization not all nodes are as planned" ✅ Added all components
- "controls of grid are horrible. bad design, bad colors" ✅ Using MUI components
- "the cards on this tab are too big" ✅ Made smaller
- "overall application should use thin and dark theme scrolls" ⏳ Pending
- "port 4000 should not serve html anymore" ⏳ Pending

## Known Issues
1. Backend still serves HTML on port 4000
2. TypeScript compilation errors in SessionsView
3. Memory Management still uses cards instead of bar chart
4. Dark theme scrollbars not implemented globally

## Session End Note
Session ended due to IDE performance issues. All work saved to this file for continuation in a new session.
