## Performance Metrics

| Operation | Response Time | Success Rate |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Web Search | 3-5 seconds | 100% |
| File Read | < 1 second | 100% |
| File Write | < 1 second | 60% |
| Complex Tasks | 10-20 seconds | 90% |

## Known Issues

1. **File Creation Inconsistency**
   - Files not always created despite success message
   - Needs investigation of approval flow

2. **Approval Flow**
   - Not currently prompting for user approval
   - Security consideration for production

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Deploy to production (web search fully functional)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor file operations for consistency
3. üîß Fix approval flow for file operations

### Future Enhancements
1. Add more search engines via SerpAPI
2. Implement retry logic for failed operations
3. Add telemetry for performance monitoring

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Web Search Tests
echo 'search for "Bitcoin price today" using web_search tool' | ./start-deepseek.sh
echo 'search for "machine learning papers" using web_search tool with search_type "scholar"' | ./start-deepseek.sh
