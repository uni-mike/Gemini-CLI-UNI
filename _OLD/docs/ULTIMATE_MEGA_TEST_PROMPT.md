# ULTIMATE MEGA TEST PROMPT - Copy-Paste Ready

## üéØ MEGA TEST PROMPT (Copy this for CLI interactive testing)

```
Search the web for "JavaScript async await best practices 2025", then create async-guide.md with the findings, then read package.json to extract the project name and version, then create a new TypeScript file utils/validator.ts with an email validation function using regex, then search the codebase for any existing validation functions, then update utils/validator.ts to add phone number validation, then create utils/validator.test.ts with unit tests for both functions, then run ls -la utils to verify the files were created, then search the web for "TypeScript testing best practices", then update the test file with better test cases based on the findings, then create a JSON file test-results.json with test execution results, then read the validator.ts file to analyze the code quality, then create code-review.md with improvement suggestions, then update validator.ts based on the review feedback, then run npm list --depth=0 to check installed packages, then create dependencies-report.md listing all dependencies with their purposes, then search the codebase for TODO comments, then create todo-list.json with all found TODOs, then search the web for "Node.js performance optimization techniques", then create performance-guide.md with optimization strategies, then create a shell script run-tests.sh that executes all tests, then run chmod +x run-tests.sh to make it executable, then create a comprehensive README.md that documents everything created, finally create a summary-report.json with statistics about all operations performed
```

## ‚ö° SHORTER VERSION (For quick testing)

```
Search the web for "React hooks best practices", then create hooks-guide.md with findings, then create components/Button.tsx with a React button component, then create components/Button.test.tsx with tests, then run ls -la components to list files, then read package.json for dependencies, then create project-info.json with project details, finally create TESTING_COMPLETE.md summarizing all actions
```

## üöÄ COMPLEX CODE VERSION

```
Create a TypeScript class models/User.ts with properties for name, email, and age with validation, then create models/User.test.ts with comprehensive tests, then search the web for "TypeScript OOP best practices", then update models/User.ts based on the best practices, then create interfaces/IUser.ts with the user interface, then update models/User.ts to implement the interface, then create models/UserCollection.ts that manages multiple users, then create a usage example in examples/user-demo.ts, then run npm init -y to create package.json if needed, then create tsconfig.json with TypeScript configuration, finally create BUILD_STATUS.md with compilation results
```
