So we must write exactly:

Hello World

 However, the task decomposition part is only for the steps to create the file? But the user also says: "Break this down into numbered steps: You must generate the actual file content ..."

 But then the instruction also says: "Return ONLY a numbered list. No thinking, no explanations, just: 1. ... 2. ..."

 However, the user also says: "After thinking, you must output the complete file content ..."

 This seems to be two parts.

 But note the initial system prompt: "Return ONLY a numbered list. ..."

 And the user's input: "Break this down into numbered steps: ..."

 So we are to break down the task of generating the file into steps? But then the user also says that after thinking we must output the file content.

 How to reconcile?

 Let me re-read the user's input:

 "Break this down into numbered steps: You must generate the actual file content for /Users/mike.admon/UNIPATH_PROJECT/gemini-cli/hello-test.txt.

 Generate appropriate content for the specified file type.

 Task: create hello-test.txt with content 'Hello World'

 IMPORTANT: After thinking, you must output the complete file content that will be saved directly to /Users/mike.admon/UNIPATH_PROJECT/gemini-cli/hello-test.txt."

 And the system prompt says: "Return ONLY a numbered list. No thinking, no explanations, just: 1. ... 2. ..."

 But then the user also says
