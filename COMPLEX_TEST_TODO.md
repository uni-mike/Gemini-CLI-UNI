# Complex Full-Stack App Test for FlexiCLI with DeepSeek-V3.1

## Test Objective
Validate that FlexiCLI with DeepSeek-V3.1 can handle a complex, multi-faceted development task using all available tools while monitoring performance and success.

## Test Prompt
"Create a complete Todo application with React frontend and Express backend. Include:
1) Backend API with CRUD operations for todos (Express + TypeScript)
2) Frontend with React and TypeScript
3) SQLite database with Prisma ORM
4) Authentication with JWT
5) Tests for API endpoints
6) Docker compose setup
7) README with setup instructions
8) Search for best practices online first"

## Results

### ‚úÖ Successes:
- Model configuration correctly updated to DeepSeek-V3.1
- Monitoring system working and tracking all events
- Web search tool executed successfully for best practices
- Bash tools executed (mkdir commands)
- Retry mechanism working properly (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Token tracking working (1626 tokens for planning, 1840 for execution)
- User feedback during retries displayed correctly

### ‚ùå Issues Found:
- API timeouts on all 3 retry attempts (30 seconds each)
- Complex prompts causing DeepSeek API to hang
- File creation failed due to wrong directory structure
- Test ultimately failed with AbortError after exhausting retries

### üìà Performance Analysis:
- Total execution time: ~110 seconds (failed after 3x30s timeouts)
- Total tokens used: 3466 (before failure)
- Number of retries: 3
- Number of tools executed: 4 (web, bash x2, file)
- Files created: 0 (failed on first file)

### üéØ Final Score: 4/10

## Recommendations
- Investigate why DeepSeek-V3.1 API is timing out on complex prompts
- Consider increasing timeout beyond 30 seconds for complex tasks
- May need to simplify prompts or break them into smaller chunks
- Check if Azure endpoint is experiencing issues
- Consider implementing partial response handling to avoid complete failures
