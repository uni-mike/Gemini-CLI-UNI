# UNIPATH CLI Session Status Report
Date: September 9, 2025

## 🎯 Original Objective
Fix UNIPATH CLI to properly handle multi-step operations and provide clear outputs, especially for price queries and complex tasks.

## ✅ Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Tool Selection ✅
- **Problem**: DeepSeek was using `search_file_content` instead of `web_search` for internet queries
- **Solution**: Updated prompts in `DeepSeekPrompts.ts` to explicitly guide tool selection
- **File**: `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekPrompts.ts`
- **Status**: WORKING PERFECTLY

### 2. Added Bottom Line Summaries ✅
- **Problem**: User complained "not clear to user whats the bottom line" for Bitcoin price searches
- **Solution**: Modified prompts to include 📊 format and clear price summaries
- **File**: `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekPrompts.ts`
- **Result**: Now shows `📊 Bitcoin is currently at $X USD`
- **Status**: WORKING PERFECTLY

### 3. Fixed Visual Output ✅
- **Problem**: Too many "↻ Continuing (2/5)..." messages cluttering output
- **Solution**: Modified iteration logic to only show continuation when needed
- **File**: `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekClient.ts`
- **Status**: WORKING - Clean output

### 4. Fixed Parameter Mapping ✅
- **Problem**: "params must have required property 'absolute_path'" errors
- **Solution**: Added `mapToolParameters` method to map file_path → absolute_path
- **File**: `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekToolExecutor.ts`
- **Status**: WORKING - No more parameter errors

### 5. Improved Orchestration Detection ✅
- **Problem**: Simple tasks like "create test.txt" were being marked as complex
- **Solution**: Refined detection logic to exclude "test" when it's part of filename
- **File**: `/packages/core/src/core/deepSeekWithOrchestration.ts`
- **Status**: WORKING - Correctly identifies simple vs complex

### 6. All Core Features Working ✅
- Simple arithmetic: Direct calculation, no tools
- Web searches: Using correct tool with 📊 summaries
- File operations: Creating/editing files correctly
- Multi-step tasks: Execute sequentially (without trio orchestration)

## ❌ Failed / Incomplete

### 1. Orchestration System (Trio Pattern) ❌
**STATUS: BROKEN - HANGS ON EXECUTION**

**The Problem:**
When `useOrchestration = true` and a complex task is detected, the system hangs at:
```
🎭 Complex task detected - engaging intelligent orchestration...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[HANGS HERE FOREVER]
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The orchestration trio (Planner → Executor → Orchestrator) is not properly connected
2. `Executor` class doesn't have access to actual tool implementations
3. `Planner` doesn't have AI model for intelligent task decomposition
4. `DeepSeekOrchestrator.integrateDeepSeekTools()` tries to call `executeToolDirectly()` which doesn't exist

**What We Tried:**
1. ✅ Detection logic works - correctly identifies complex tasks
2. ❌ Added `executeToolDirectly()` method but it's not properly connected
3. ❌ Tried to route through parent class but async generator hangs
4. ❌ Attempted to connect tools to Executor but missing proper registry access

**Current Workaround:**
- Orchestration detection runs but execution falls back to sequential DeepSeek
- Multi-step tasks work fine, just not with the trio pattern

## 📁 Key Files to Review

### Working Files:
1. `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekClient.ts` - Main client, handles tool execution
2. `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekPrompts.ts` - Prompts for tool selection and summaries
3. `/packages/core/src/ai-clients/deepseek/DeepSeekToolExecutor.ts` - Tool execution with parameter mapping

### Problem Files:
1. `/packages/core/src/core/deepSeekWithOrchestration.ts` - Orchestration detection works, execution hangs
2. `/packages/core/src/orchestration/DeepSeekOrchestrator.ts` - Tries to integrate tools but method missing
3. `/packages/core/src/orchestration/Orchestrator.ts` - Main orchestrator, Promise never resolves
4. `/packages/core/src/orchestration/Executor.ts` - No access to actual tool implementations
5. `/packages/core/src/orchestration/Planner.ts` - No AI model, falls back to heuristics

## 🔍 What We Suspect

### The Hanging Issue:
1. **Async Generator Problem**: When calling `super.sendMessageStreamWithTools(message)` from within the orchestration block, the async generator might be getting consumed but not properly yielding
2. **Circular Dependency**: Possible circular reference between DeepSeekWithOrchestration → DeepSeekOrchestrator → DeepSeekWithTools
3. **Missing Tool Bridge**: Executor needs a proper bridge to DeepSeekToolExecutor

### Potential Solutions:
1. **Option 1**: Properly connect Executor to DeepSeekToolExecutor's registry
2. **Option 2**: Bypass the trio and use DeepSeek's native multi-step handling
3. **Option 3**: Rewrite orchestration to use promises instead of async generators
4. **Option 4**: Create a proper tool bridge class that both systems can use

## 📋 Test Results

### Passing Tests ✅
- Simple arithmetic: `2 + 2` → "equals 4"
- Bitcoin price: Shows 📊 summary
- File creation: Creates files correctly
- List files: Works
- JSON files: Creates valid JSON
- Stock prices: Shows 📊 summary

### Failing Tests ❌
- Complex task with orchestration enabled: HANGS
- "search X then create Y" with trio: HANGS

## 🚀 Current State

**With orchestration disabled (`useOrchestration = false`):**
- ✅ Everything works perfectly
- ✅ Multi-step tasks execute sequentially
- ✅ Clean visual output
- ✅ Clear bottom-line summaries

**With orchestration enabled (`useOrchestration = true`):**
- ✅ Detection works correctly
- ❌ Execution hangs indefinitely
- ❌ Must kill process manually

## 📝 Next Session TODO

1. **Fix the orchestration hanging issue**
   - Connect Executor to actual tool implementations
   - Fix async generator consumption in orchestration block
   - Ensure Planner has AI model access

2. **Test with orchestration fully working**
   - Verify trio pattern executes properly
   - Test parallel task execution
   - Confirm no performance degradation

3. **Clean up**
   - Remove debug console.logs
   - Update documentation
   - Create proper tests

## 💡 Important Context for Next Session

**User's Key Directive:**
"never do UNIPATH CLI work, if something not ok -> fix the UNIPATH CLI !!! remember that directive"

**User's Expectations:**
- Orchestration should work with the trio pattern
- Clear bottom-line summaries for all queries
- No hanging or blocking operations
- Multi-step tasks should leverage orchestration

**Current Workaround:**
The system is production-ready with orchestration disabled, but the user wants the full trio pattern working.

## 🔧 Quick Commands for Testing

```bash
# Test simple task
APPROVAL_MODE=yolo ./start-deepseek.sh --prompt "What is 2 + 2?" --non-interactive

# Test web search
APPROVAL_MODE=yolo ./start-deepseek.sh --prompt "Bitcoin price" --non-interactive

# Test complex task (this hangs with orchestration enabled)
APPROVAL_MODE=yolo ./start-deepseek.sh --prompt "search Bitcoin price then create btc-report.txt" --non-interactive

# Kill hanging process
pkill -f start-deepseek
```

## 🎭 The Core Issue

**The orchestration system is architecturally disconnected from the tool execution system.**

The trio (Planner/Executor/Orchestrator) was designed as a separate system but needs deep integration with DeepSeekToolExecutor to actually execute tools. This is the fundamental issue that needs to be resolved.
