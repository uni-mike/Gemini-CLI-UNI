# FlexiCLI System Autonomy Requirements

## Core Principle: Independent Operation

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The monitoring system and agent system MUST operate completely autonomously without interfering with each other.

## Issue Identified
Multiple background processes running simultaneously cause resource conflicts and system interference:
- Agent execution fails when monitoring is enabled
- Database path conflicts between systems
- Port conflicts and resource contention
- Background processes not properly isolated

## Architecture Requirements

### 1. Process Isolation
- Monitoring system runs as separate process with own resources
- Agent system runs independently without monitoring interference
- No shared process pools or resource locks

### 2. Database Isolation
- Both systems can use same database but different connection pools
- No table locking conflicts
- Separate transaction scopes

### 3. Port Management
- Monitoring system uses dedicated ports (4000, 3000)
- Agent system uses separate ports or no ports for non-interactive mode
- No port conflicts between systems

### 4. Resource Management
- Independent memory allocation
- Separate API timeout configurations
- No shared state that can cause deadlocks

## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Protocol
1. Test agent WITHOUT monitoring enabled first
2. Test monitoring system independently
3. Test both systems running simultaneously
4. Validate no interference or performance degradation

### Error Handling
- System failures must not cascade between monitoring and agent
- Independent error recovery mechanisms
- No shared error states

### Monitoring System
- Should observe agent behavior WITHOUT affecting it
- Read-only access to agent database for metrics
- Cannot modify agent execution flow

### Agent System
- Must work perfectly with ENABLE_MONITORING=false
- Can optionally emit monitoring events when ENABLE_MONITORING=true
- Core functionality unaffected by monitoring state

## Compliance Check
- [ ] Agent works standalone (ENABLE_MONITORING=false)
- [ ] Monitoring works standalone
- [ ] Both work together without interference
- [ ] No resource conflicts or port conflicts
- [ ] Independent process lifecycle management
- [ ] No shared locks or blocking operations

## User Expectation
"Both can and should work autonomously" - the systems must be completely independent while optionally working together.
