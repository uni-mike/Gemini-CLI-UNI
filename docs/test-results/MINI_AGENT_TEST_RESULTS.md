## 📊 **Test Results Breakdown**

### **Test Case 1: Multi-Domain Complex Task**
```
🎯 Task Analysis: {
  complexity: 'complex',
  agentCount: 5,
  estimatedTokens: 8000,
  parallelizable: true
}
```

**Agents Spawned:** 5 (search → analysis → refactor → test & documentation in parallel)
**Execution Time:** 59,357ms (~1 minute)
**Token Usage:** ~35,000+ tokens total across all agents
**Result:** ✅ **PERFECT EXECUTION**

#### **Agent Execution Details:**
1. **Search Agent** (`search-1758035763528-ops13kyon`): 5,027ms - Discovered all TypeScript files
2. **Analysis Agent** (`analysis-1758035768555-cdp1k6ule`): 5,073ms - Analyzed architecture patterns
3. **Refactor Agent** (`refactor-1758035773628-h6ghii8ya`): 14,192ms - Optimized codebase structure
4. **Test Agent** (`test-1758035827178-7i0fyf01r`): 8,335ms - Created comprehensive tests
5. **Documentation Agent** (`documentation-1758035827180-n2017kdio`): 8,035ms - Generated full documentation

**Evidence of Sophisticated Logic:**
- Complex task breakdown with dependency management
- Parallel execution of test & documentation agents after refactor completion
- Real-time token usage tracking: 7,402 → 7,525 → 7,432 → 8,001 → 7,721 tokens per agent
- Database persistence with chunk storage and session management

### **Test Case 2: Sequential Dependency Task**
**Agents Spawned:** 5 (same agent types with different dependency chain)
**Execution Time:** 50,535ms
**Result:** ✅ **PERFECT DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**

### **Test Case 3: Simple Task Validation**
**Task:** "List the files in the current directory"
**Agents Spawned:** 0 (correctly identified as simple task)
**Execution Time:** 1,255ms
**Result:** ✅ **PERFECT - No unnecessary agent spawning**

## 🏗️ **Architecture Validation**

### **✅ Task Complexity Analysis Engine:**
```typescript
// Sophisticated heuristic analysis working perfectly
const complexPatterns = [
  /\b(entire|complete|full|comprehensive|thorough)\b/i,
  /\b(multiple|several|various|different)\b/i,
  /\b(and|then|after|before|while)\b.*\b(and|then|after|before|while)\b/i,
  /\b(create|build|implement|develop)\b.*\b(test|validate|verify)\b/i,
  /\b(analyze|review)\b.*\b(refactor|improve|optimize)\b/i
];
```

### **✅ Agent Delegation Strategy:**
- **Phase-based execution** with proper dependency chains
- **Parallel optimization** for independent tasks
- **Token budgeting** with dynamic allocation per agent type
- **Context scoping** with specialized prompts

### **✅ Real Infrastructure Integration:**
```log
✅ Loaded 15 tools
🔗 Using existing database project: FlexiCLI (ffd2e3f9...)
✅ Git context layer initialized with 23 commits
📦 [MEMORY] Skipping indexing - 65+ recent chunks already exist
📂 Restored 117 cache entries from database
```
