Please help me with a comprehensive task that involves multiple steps:

1. Search the web for "React performance tips 2025"
2. Read the package.json file 
3. Create a summary report called REACT_PERFORMANCE.md
4. Run a shell command to check npm version
5. Search for any files containing "optimization" in the codebase

This should test the auto-execution flow after chunking.
