However, the user's instruction says: "After thinking, you must output the complete file content that will be saved directly to /Users/mike.admon/UNIPATH_PROJECT/gemini-cli/react-ink-ui-final.txt."

 So, we skip the numbered steps and output the content as per the final instruction.

 But wait, the system prompt says: "Return ONLY a numbered list. No thinking, no explanations, just: 1. ... 2. ..."

 However, the user's instruction overrides: "IMPORTANT: After thinking, you must output the complete file content..."

 Therefore, we must output the content, not a numbered list.

 However, the initial system prompt says: "Return ONLY a numbered list." and the task decomposition.

 But note: the user's task says: "Break this down into numbered steps" and then says "After thinking, you must output the complete file content".

 This is conflicting. How to resolve?

 Let me re-read the user's message:

 "Break this down into numbered steps: You must generate the actual file content ... IMPORTANT: After thinking, you must output the complete file content ..."

 The user is asking for two things:
 1. Break down the task of creating the file into numbered steps (as per the system's role)
 2. Then, after that, output the complete file content.

 But the system prompt says: "Return ONLY a numbered list."

 However, the user's instruction says: "After thinking, you must output the complete file content"

 So, I think the user expects:
 - First, the numbered steps (as per the system's role of task decomposition)
 - Then, the file content (as per the user's specific instruction
