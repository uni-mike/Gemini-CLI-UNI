# Solution Documentation

## Overview
This solution provides a comprehensive documentation system for software projects, featuring automated generation, version control integration, and multiple output formats.

## Architecture
The system consists of three main components:
1. Documentation Generator - Creates documentation from source code and comments
2. Version Control Integration - Links documentation with code changes
3. Output Formatter - Supports multiple formats (HTML, PDF, Markdown)

## Key Features
- Automated API documentation extraction
- Cross-reference linking between documentation sections
- Responsive design for all devices
- Search functionality
- Version history tracking
- Multi-language support

## Implementation Details
The solution uses a modular architecture with clear separation between content extraction, processing, and rendering components. All documentation is stored alongside code in the repository for version consistency.

## Usage
```bash
# Generate documentation
python generate_docs.py --input src/ --output docs/

# Update specific sections
python update_docs.py --module authentication

# Export to different formats
python export_docs.py --format html,pdf
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Markdown processing libraries
- PDF generation tools
- Version control system integration

## Configuration
Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Output formats
- Documentation style
- Section ordering
- Excluded files/directories

## Maintenance
Regularly run the documentation generator after significant code changes. The system includes self-documenting features that track when documentation was last updated relative to code changes.
