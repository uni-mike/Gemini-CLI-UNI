# Performance Optimization Guide for Gemini CLI

## Introduction
This guide provides optimization strategies to enhance the speed, efficiency, and resource utilization of the Gemini CLI tool. Implement these techniques to improve user experience and system performance.

## Core Optimization Strategies

### 1. Minimize Network Calls
- Batch API requests
- Implement local caching of frequent queries
- Use connection pooling

### 2. Stream Processing
python
# Example of streaming response handling
for chunk in response_stream:
    process(chunk)
    yield chunk

### 3. Memory Management
- Use generators instead of lists for large datasets
- Release unused objects explicitly
- Set memory boundaries for operations

### 4. Concurrency Model
python
# Thread pool example
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process_task, task_list))

### 5. Dependency Optimization
- Audit and remove unused libraries
- Use lightweight alternatives for heavy dependencies
- Lazy-load non-essential modules

## Performance Metrics
| Metric | Target | Monitoring Tool |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Response Time | < 500ms | Prometheus |
| Memory Usage | < 100MB | Py-Spy |
| CPU Utilization | < 70% | cProfile |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Enable response streaming
- [ ] Implement request batching
- [ ] Set up memory profiling
- [ ] Conduct dependency audit
- [ ] Configure connection pooling

## Troubleshooting
1. Identify bottlenecks using `cProfile`:
bash
python -
