I have a complex multi-step task. Please help me break it down into smaller, manageable chunks and create a TODO list. Here's the full task:

TASK: Complete comprehensive testing that involves:
1. Web searches for React hooks, TypeScript 5.0, and Node.js optimization
2. File analysis of package.json, TODO comments, React imports, and deprecated content  
3. Create documentation files: TECH_RESEARCH_REPORT.md, TODO_LIST.md, DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md
4. Edit README.md to add Latest Updates section
5. Update 2024 to 2025 in files
6. Add review comment to deepSeekWithTools.ts
7. Run shell commands: ls packages/, node --version, npm list, mkdir backups
8. Final web search for UNIPATH alternatives
9. Create ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md summary

Please break this down into 5-7 smaller, focused tasks that I can execute one at a time. Create a clear TODO list.
