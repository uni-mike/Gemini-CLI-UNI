- ✅ All agent templates available (search, migration, analysis, refactor, test, documentation, general)
- ✅ Context scoping and specialized prompts working

#### **C. Live Execution Tests:**

**Simple Task (Main Orchestrator):**
```
Task: "What is 5+3?"
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - "5 + 3 = 8" (7,063 tokens)
```

**Mini-Agent Task (executeAsAgent):**
```
Task: "List files in current directory" with search agent context
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Full execution with specialized prompt (7,181 tokens)
```

**Evidence of Mini-Agent Context Scoping:**
```log
🎭 orchestrator → planner: 📝 Please create a plan for: [MINI-AGENT SEARCH]
Task: List files in current directory

You are a specialized search agent. Stay focused on this specific task.
Token limit: 3000
Be efficient and report progress clearly.
```
