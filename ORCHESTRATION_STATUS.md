# UNIPATH CLI Orchestration Status

## Current State
**Orchestration: DISABLED** (but detection logic improved)

## Test Results Summary

### âœ… Working Features

1. **Simple Task Detection**
   - Arithmetic: Correctly identified as SIMPLE
   - Single file creation: Correctly identified as SIMPLE
   - Single web search: Correctly identified as SIMPLE
   - Test results: All execute perfectly without orchestration

2. **Complex Task Detection** 
   - "search X then create Y": Correctly identified as COMPLEX
   - Multiple action verbs: Correctly identified as COMPLEX
   - Detection logic improved to avoid false positives (e.g., "test.txt" no longer triggers)

3. **Visual Output Quality**
   - ðŸ“Š summaries for all price queries
   - Clean tool execution display
   - No "Continuing..." spam
   - No duplicate tool calls
   - No parameter errors

4. **All Core Functionality**
   - Web searches: Working with clear summaries
   - File operations: Creating files correctly
   - Directory listing: Working
   - Multi-step tasks: Execute correctly even without orchestration

## Known Issues

### Orchestration Hanging
When `useOrchestration = true`:
- Simple tasks work fine
- Complex tasks get detected correctly
- BUT: Orchestration process hangs at "ðŸŽ­ Complex task detected - engaging intelligent orchestration..."
- Root cause: `orchestrator.orchestratePrompt()` starts but doesn't complete

### Technical Details
```typescript
// In deepSeekWithOrchestration.ts
private useOrchestration: boolean = false; // Disabled due to hanging

// When enabled, this hangs:
const result = await this.orchestrator.orchestratePrompt(userMessage);
```

The issue appears to be in the Orchestrator/Planner/Executor trio:
1. Planner creates plan but may not have AI model properly configured
2. Executor may be waiting for tasks that never start
3. No timeout or error handling for stuck orchestration

## Temporary Solution
With orchestration disabled:
- Complex tasks still execute correctly using the parent class (DeepSeekWithTools)
- Users get the same functionality, just without the trio pattern
- All tests pass successfully

## Future Fix Required
To properly enable orchestration:
1. Debug why `orchestrator.orchestratePrompt()` hangs
2. Add timeout handling to orchestration
3. Ensure Planner has access to AI model for task decomposition
4. Add proper error handling and fallback to direct execution
5. Test with complex multi-step workflows

## Test Coverage
All tests passing with orchestration disabled:
- âœ… Simple arithmetic
- âœ… Web searches (Bitcoin, Ethereum, stocks)
- âœ… File operations (txt, md, json)
- âœ… Directory listing
- âœ… Multi-step tasks (executed sequentially)
- âœ… Edge cases
- âœ… No errors in output

## Recommendation
Keep orchestration disabled until the hanging issue is resolved. The system works perfectly for all practical use cases without it.
