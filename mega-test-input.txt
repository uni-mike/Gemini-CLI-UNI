Please complete the following comprehensive task that requires multiple tools and operations:

1. **Research Phase** (Web Search):
   - Search for "best practices for React hooks 2025"
   - Search for "TypeScript 5.0 new features"
   - Search for "Node.js performance optimization techniques"

2. **File Analysis Phase** (Read/Search):
   - Read the package.json file to understand project dependencies
   - Search for all TypeScript files containing "TODO" comments
   - Find all files that import React
   - Check if there are any files with "deprecated" in their content

3. **Documentation Creation** (Write/Create):
   - Create a new file called `TECH_RESEARCH_REPORT.md` with:
     - Summary of the React hooks best practices found
     - List of TypeScript 5.0 features
     - Node.js optimization tips
   - Create a `TODO_LIST.md` file listing all TODOs found in the codebase
   - Create a `DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md` analyzing the current dependencies

4. **Code Modification** (Edit - triggers approvals):
   - Edit the main README.md to add a section "## Latest Updates" with today's date
   - Find and update any file containing "2024" to "2025" 
   - Add a comment "// Reviewed on [today's date]" to the top of deepSeekWithTools.ts

5. **Shell Operations** (Shell commands):
   - Run `ls -la packages/` to list all packages
   - Check Node version with `node --version`
   - Run `npm list --depth=0` to see direct dependencies
   - Create a backup directory with `mkdir -p backups/$(date +%Y%m%d)`

6. **Final Analysis**:
   - Search the web for "UNIPATH CLI alternatives comparison"
   - Create a final `ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md` summarizing everything done

Please execute all these tasks, showing the approval prompts for edits, and handle multiple parallel tool executions where possible. Make sure to use the web_search tool multiple times and trigger the approval flow for file modifications.
